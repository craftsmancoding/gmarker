## 6. Testing

Now that you have configured the Gmarker Extra, try creating a new location page.  Be sure to choose the template you created previously.  Enter in some address data and save the page.  Then refresh your browser: you should see the latitude and longitude data appear in your dedicated TVs!

If you don't see this, check the MODX error logs.
